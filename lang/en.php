$about = "This program helps users to be fully aware of drugs, their use and how to use them in their own language. In the first step, all the medicines that are common and can be obtained without a prescription from the pharmacy are stored in this program. In addition, the program allows the program manager to record and store other types of medications. Unfortunately, in a country like Afghanistan, most people do not have a proper and scientific knowledge about drugs and their proper use. So I decided to design, design and develop this application using (Android) so that I could. On the one hand, this application provides useful information about drugs and their proper use to my dear people, and on the other hand, it shows the positive role of technology. \n\nNote: This application is for information only, and the use of drugs without consulting a doctor and pharmacist (pharmacist) can cause any risk. Therefore, in the first step, only drugs that are common and can be obtained without a prescription from the pharmacy are stored in this program.<br>
